# BiblioVisionOSHack
This is an VisionOS application called Bilbio created for the first #VisionHack VisionOS Hackathon. In collaboration with Wit O. We created an immersive reading app that allows for pdf/epub uploading and allows you to read books in a seperate window. Our goals for this project are to create an immersive view using an AI generated scene based on where you are in your book.
